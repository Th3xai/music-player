I created a responsive music player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This player has the following features:
Play/Pause button to control music.
Progress Bar to show the song's progress.
Volume Control to adjust sound.
Responsive Design that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
Simple Interface for easy use.
